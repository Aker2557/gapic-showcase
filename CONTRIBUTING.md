Contributor License Agreements
------------------------------

Before we can accept your pull requests, you will need to sign a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA):

-   **If you are an individual writing original source code** and **you
    own the intellectual property**, then you'll need to sign an
    [individual CLA].
-   **If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute
    your work**, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA].

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After
that, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.
